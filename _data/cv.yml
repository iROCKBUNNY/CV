    title: Low-Resolution Face Recognition
    label: MSc Dissertation
    authors:
      - Tong Qu
    abstract: "Traditional face recognition algorithms are not best suited for matching face images captured at a low resolution to a set of high-resolution gallery face images. To perform matching between face images of different resolutions, this work proposes a coupled-projection method. Based on local relationships in the data, two sets of projections are learned: one for low-resolution face images and the other for high-resolution face images, respectively. Then, both low-resolution probe face images and high-resolution gallery face images are projected into a common subspace. Hence, subsequent matching can be done in the subspace directly."
